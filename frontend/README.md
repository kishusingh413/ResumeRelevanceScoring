## Frontend

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the frontend system built using React with TypeScript, offering a dynamic and responsive web interface. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn UI for consistent and dynamic components. The state management is handled by Redux Toolkit, ensuring efficient data handling across the application. Axios is used in conjunction with Redux Thunk for asynchronous API calls, allowing for a seamless user experience. The application also incorporates React-PDF for viewing PDF files and Lucide-react for icons, enhancing the visual appeal and functionality of the interface. The frontend is served using Nginx and containerized alongside the backend for efficient deployment.

### Features and Implementation

- **Dynamic Components**: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI are used for styling and component consistency.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit manages the application state.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Axios with Redux Thunk handles API calls.
- **PDF Viewing**: React-PDF allows for in-app viewing of PDF files.
- **Iconography**: Lucide-react provides a wide range of icons for enhanced UI design.
- **Deployment**: Containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
